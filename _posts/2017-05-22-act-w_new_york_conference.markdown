On Friday I attended the ACT-W New York Conference, which was put together by the NYC Chapter of ChickTech, a non-profit that is dedicated to retaining and increasing the number of women in tech careers. While more women are entering tech careers, there is still an issue with retention, which is why conferences like this are needed. Overall this was a great conference -- I had to the chance to meet others who are also in the process of switching careers and from those who have already done so successfully. The atmosphere was very friendly and welcoming, which was great as a first time tech conference attendee!

The day began with a keynote talk by [Anne Krause](https://twitter.com/anne_krause?lang=en), the Executive Director of the [Hemisfair Conservancy](https://hemisfairconservancy.org/). She discussed her career path, which she admitted was not a straight path but rather was filled with detours that gave her the experiences she needed to be where she is today. Anne encouraged us to say yes to opportunities that come our way; they will be opportunities for learning and growth and will prepare you for a future you never imagined. Coming from a military background, Anne experienced a lot of competition between women early in her career. Later on she realized that no one should have to fail in order for her to succeed and that we should strive to collaborate instead of competing with other women. She recognized that many women have come before us and paved the way, but that there is still a long way to go for women and we will in turn be paving the way for future women. 

The second keynote focused on stress reduction by [Dr. Kathy Gruver](http://www.kathygruver.com/ ), an international motivational speaker and award-winning author. She started the session by having everyone close their eyes and deeply breathing in and out to the count of four. We did this a few times and by the time she had us all open our eyes again, you could feel that the tone in the room had changed and became more relaxed. Kathy explained that taking a minute to breathe forces you to pause and calms you. Stress can be perceived or imagined, she said that we choose what we want to focus on and that we don’t need to focus on stressful and negative things. Kathy encouraged us to have a positive attitude and visualize positive outcomes as this has a huge impact on your stress which in turn affects your performance (ie: keeping a positive attitude before a job interview will help you perform better). Kathy shared her 2 rules for meditation:
1. Focus on something repetitive like your breath or a positive mantra. 
2. When thoughts appear, dismiss them without judgment and return to focusing on your breath or mantra. 

Kathy encouraged meditation for relaxation, but you should do whatever works for you, like running, yoga, or reading. She suggested meditative breathing before potentially stressful activities such as interviews or talks because meditating stops your fight or flight response and will calm you. Kathy then explained the two types of communication -- direct: getting straight to your point without any extra conversation, and indirect: including extra information when communicating such as the reasoning behind your actions. She emphasized being present when listening to people in order to really hear what they are saying and that you better communicate and connect with people when you match their communication style. 

Next were 5 lightning talks by 5 amazing women in tech!

First up was [Natasha Awasthi](https://natashaawasthi.me/ ) with *Mind Tricks to Make the Hard Stuff Easy*. Natasha gave us five pieces of advice to help us navigate the male dominated tech industry. I think Natasha hit the nail on the head regarding to many of the inner dialogues women (or at least I) have. We should all keep these five points in mind when impostor syndrome tries to sneak in:
* You are not bragging when you share your accomplishments, you are earning trust.
* You are not a power monger, you are a role model for other women (and men too!).
* You are not networking, you are building a community of people to support you.
* You are not seeking contradictions when you bring up an issue, you are exploring solutions for that issue.
* Don’t get mad, get what you want. Use  your anger as a catalyst for action, look ahead to see what you can do to effect permanent change. 

Second was *How to Be a Software Engineer Without an MFA* by [YZ Chin](https://www.yzchin.com/ ). YZ is a writer in addition to being a software engineer and did not take the “traditional path” to becoming an engineer. In her talk, YZ discussed how her untraditional background is an asset in her career. She explained that when everyone is good at the same thing and has a similar background, they all tend to think the same way which can lead to failure. YZ stressed that different is not bad, it is an opportunity and that your unique background allows you to think and contribute in unique ways. An example she gave was that in her first role as a developer, there was an issue with a database, since she just started she was unable to help with the code audit so she looked over the user logs for the database and found an issue there that led the team to fixing the problem quickly. Her contribution to solving the problem did not come from her technical training, but her many years of experience in the industry which gave her an advantage over other coders that took a traditional path. YZ left us with a trick to avoiding impostor syndrome -- you are not an impostor as long as you are honest with yourself and others.  

Next up was [Bie Aweh](https://twitter.com/allhailqueenbie?lang=en ) speaking about *Diversity and Dialogue: Making it Count*. Bie pointed out that there is currently more demand than supply for tech jobs and this means that employers will need to see the value in job candidates with non traditional paths. Coding bootcamps attract more women and minorities than traditional CS programs, which are still overwhelmingly made up of white males. If employers want to diversify their workforce they will need to look beyond candidates with CS degrees. Bei explained the need for apprenticeship programs and training of early career employees, this investment during the early years of their career leads to greater retention of employees, especially women and minorities who may feel marginalized. 

[Nicole Drummond](http://www.nicoleraedrummond.com/  ) spoke next on *How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Negotiating*. Nicole told us that only 7% of women negotiate their salaries at their first or second jobs! She also told us that we shouldn’t be afraid to negotiate -- 90% of hiring managers say they have never rescinded an offer because a person has tried to negotiate. Some resources to do salary research that Nicole suggests are [AngelList](https://angel.co/), [Glassdoor]https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm), and [LinkedIn Salary](https://www.linkedin.com/salary/). Nicole’s adivice for negotiating is to get them to talk numbers first so that you don’t get boxed into a certain salary range. You do this by emphasizing that you are more interested in seeing if the company is a good fit first and that you can discuss salary later.  She also told us to keep in mind that there are other non-monetary benefits that we should consider during negotiating such as telecommuting, vacation days, and equity!

Last, but not least, was [Nancy Mond](https://www.donorschoose.org/about/meet_the_team.html#nancy) from [DonorsChoose](https://www.donorschoose.org/) with *Change the World: Write Software*. Using the examples of [Kiva](https://www.kiva.org/), [DonorsChoose](https://www.donorschoose.org/), [Charity:Water](https://www.charitywater.org/), and [GlobalGiving](https://www.globalgiving.org/), Nancy discussed how tech enables charities to do amazing things. She made us aware that there are many non-profit organizations that need tech professionals and encouraged us to use our skills for good and to make a positive impact on the world.

After lunch there were a series of breakout sessions. All of the sessions sounded great and it was a tough choice to decide which sessions to attend!

Having a humanities background, I decided to first attend *Integrating Humanities into the 21st Century: Humanities and CAD* by Eldrid Sequeira from [Dimension Learning](http://www.dimensionlearning.org/). Eldrid explained that humans look for patterns and structures, and that integrating the humanities into products can give you a competitive edge. We looked at how this can be used with visuals using the golden ratio and with content using Aristotle’s three modes of persuasion and behavioral science. 

Next I checked out *Normalizing Career Change* with Christa Donato  and Anna Krieger from [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/). They explained that there are more options available to you than you realized if you stray from the obvious path. When creating your personal narrative, they said that it is important to realize that what you are doing now to change/advance your career is just adding to what you have already done. The stressed that even though you are changing careers, you do not need to eliminate all of your past experiences from your resume.  Self reflection is important and the first step to developing your personal narrative. 

The next session I attended was with [Lori Stahl-Van Brackle](https://loristahlvanbrackle.wordpress.com/), *Teaching with Technology as a Creative Tool*. Lori has developed the curricula for project based technology courses for middle school students in New York City. She explained that tech classes should aim to teach students new skills and hone the skills they already know. Tech classes can also help students learn in a different way by incorporating other academic subjects (such as history, art, or writing)  into the project. 

The last session I attended was *Navigating the Workplace: Career Path in a Growing Environment* with Megan Dow, Mahdis Rezael, Erin Lee, and Samantha Levenson from [Blue Apron](https://www.blueapron.com/). This panel gave some great insight into working in tech as a woman from a variety of viewpoints, veteran engineers, a career changer, and a recruiter. Megan (a veteran engineer) said that being assertive and confident allowed her to climb the ladder, this change in attitude seemed to carry more weight than what she said. She also said that when you are making bold statements you need to make sure you are prepared to back-up what you said with data. One of my fellow attendees asked the women for advice for when you are looking for your first engineering job, here is what they had to say:
* An online presence is really important! Make sure you are on github and that you have some programs on there, specifically an algorithm based one. Creating a website from scratch is also a good idea because it shows you are serious about coding. However, if you can’t make the website well you should skip it. 
* Practice whiteboarding algorithm problems.
* Keep busy with meetups to expand your network and side projects. Some ideas of things to do were to freelance, contribute to open source projects, and participate in hackathons. 
* If you know what industry you are interested in working in, build an app that is related. 
* Email recruiters and make sure you keep in contact with your network. 
* Make sure you are able to articulate your strengths and why you want to be a software engineer. 

**TL/DR:** This was a great conference and is definitely worth attending! There are a few more upcoming in cities across the USA ([act-w.org](http://www.act-w.org/)). Everyone from the speakers to the volunteers were friendly and welcoming, I highly recommend this conference and will be attending again next year!
