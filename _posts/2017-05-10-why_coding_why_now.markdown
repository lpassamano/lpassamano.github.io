title:  Why coding? Why now?

I first started seriously coding at the job I had while I was in graduate school. We used a terribly outdated CMS that made formatting a nightmare and I quickly realized that I could manipulate the HTML source code which made everything easier. Before that, I knew about coding from a mandatory course during undergrad, which was not so jokingly called MySpace 101, and the Matrix. Basically, I knew nothing and wasn't interested in learning more than what I needed to make my job easier. That was until I was laid off and discovered Codecademy and the power of code to create.

Let me quickly back up to tell you a little bit more about myself. I have been involved in the arts from a young age -- from drawing with my father (who went to art school before switching careers), playing flute, acting in plays, dancing, to my undergraduate thesis on corsetry. When it came to college and grad school I followed what I was interested in, getting a BA in Art History and Theatrical Costuming Production and Design and an MA in Art History. I always enjoyed creating things and problem solving and the arts allowed me to do both (mostly because you had to make things happen on a shoestring budget). After grad school I continued to work at the same place I had during my studies, but after a few years I was laid off due to lack of funding. 

During my forced time off, I started to do the HTML and CSS lessons on Codecademy, thinking they would be great additions to my resume. I devoured them. I was hooked and moved on to starting the JS lessons there and on Khan Academy.

After about half a year, the center where I had worked had received a new grant and wanted me back as part of the team. I wasn't able to dedicate as much time to learning code and eventually stopped practicing all together. But I still couldn't shake my desire to learn more. Over the past few years I had a couple of false starts in pursuing coding -- signing up for an online course on Ruby and applying to the CS program at my local community college.

Ultimately, I decided that an online bootcamp aligned with my goals and made it possible for me to keep my current job while preparing for a new career. I decided to do this now after years of mulling the idea over because I knew I had to jump into the deep end of the pool or I would just keep thinking about dipping a toe in. As for why Flatiron? There are so many great reviews of the school, so I won't bother to rehash them here, but what made me decide I wanted to go to Flatiron over another bootcamp was the people. I attended quite a few of the information sessions before jumping in, and the people from Flatiron were the only people who took the time to answer my questions with real thoughtful answers, not a canned reply. So far, every person I have spoken with has been welcoming and helpful, whether or not you are a student. 

What I love about coding is that you are putting together patterns of words and symbols to create something. At first it seems like gibberish (see Matix gif above), but once you learn more it can be very elegant and even poetic. Also, I find great satisfaction in making things and it is very satisfying to create code and then have it actually work! I still do a little happy dance every time I finish a feature and it works on the user end. I feel there is potential for making a real impact through coding. With coding, there are infinite possibilities, you are only limited by your knowledge and creativity.
