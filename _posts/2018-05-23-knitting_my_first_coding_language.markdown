I am trying to get back on the coding wagon after taking a hiatus to put all of my energy into applying for a few positions. One interview reminded me that while I am fairly new to creating apps, I have been reading, interpreting, and creating code since I was a child in the form of knitting. 

### Basics of Knitting

All knitting is made of two basic stitches, knit and purl, which can be combined in multiple ways to create a variety of textures and patterns.

  *Yup, all of those patterns are created using just knit and purl stitches!*

Once you get onto more advanced knitting, there are some additional techniques needed, but at its core, knitting is just knit and purl stitches. Coincidentally, this is akin to how binary is used to store and transmit data in computers using series of 1s and 0s. In binary, a bit is either a 1 or a 0 and 1 can be interpreted as the opposite of 0. Similarly in knitting, a knit stitch is the opposite of a purl stitch (when looking at the “wrong” or opposite side of a knit stitch, you will see a purl, and vice versa). 

### Following a Pattern/Program

Once you’ve mastered the basic stitches, you can start adding in more complicated techniques such as increases, decreases, cables, and lace, which create shaping for knit items and additional textures. Increases/decreases are the main way to shape items. Think of how a hat curves at the top to fit around a head, that is created by decreasing the amount of stitches per row as you get closer to the top of the hat. 

So basically, in knitting the pattern is the code and you (or the knitter) are the interpreter that executes the functions laid out in the code! And once you get some mastery of the different knitting stitches and techniques you can become both the coder and interpreter. In creating some of my own patterns I learned many of the same criteria that make code good -- keep it DRY by using loops and references to earlier defined stitch patterns (like calling a method inside another method), keeping detailed notes on why you are doing what you are doing, and the importance of testing (no one likes to finish a sweater just to find out that it is 2 sizes too small because you didn’t take time to test the yarn and needles). 

So in the spirit of getting back into the swing of things, I converted [this awesome knitting pattern](http://jlyarnworks.blogspot.com/2008/07/hermiones-cable-eyelet-hat.html) into code! And [here is the quick ruby CLI program](https://github.com/lpassamano/hermoines_hat) I made that “knits” you a digital version of the hat in your terminal! Let me know if you have any questions or comments!!
