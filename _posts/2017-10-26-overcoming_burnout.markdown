October marks my sixth month learning to code with Flatiron! The first few months flew by, I was super motivated and quickly worked through the materials that I was already familiar with. Sinatra was challenging for me, but I could work through it. But then I got to the Rails section and it was like my brain turned off.

*I may be burtout, but at least I get coding jokes!*

From the beginning Rails was just not clicking for me the way the earlier materials had. I was no longer excited about what I was learning, and I was not very motivated. My first weekend learning Rails I wasn’t even able to get through one lesson, and I didn’t do much better the following week.

After a little self-reflection, I realized I was burned out and needed to take a step back. While it may seem counter-productive to take time off from studying, but in reality, it has helped me recharge and get back to coding with renewed motivation! 


**Here is how I moved past my burnout:** 
#### Stopped being so hard on myself.####

No one can give it their all 100% of the time, I realized that I needed to give myself time off before I got to the point of breaking. I used to beat myself up for taking one day off (even though I had studied every other day that week), however in the end it doesn’t make that big of a difference. And if I start to feel guilty about taking some time off again,   I will remind myself that I won’t be able to continue learning if my mental and physical health are suffering.

#### Thinking back to the last time I felt recharged.####
… and try to replicate it! This summer I spent a week in cabin in the Rockies with some of my friends. Even though it was a vacation, being in a different setting made me motivated to study. So, I planned to take a weekend to get away from everything and recharge, and you can bet I will be bringing my computer along!

#### Reflecting on how far I have come.####
Learning to code is hard, remembering where I started helped to put everything in perspective.

#### Reconnecting with the community####
Studying online can start to feel isolating. I stopped participating on Slack and Study Groups earlier this month, which contributed to my burnout. My goal for the next month is to participate in more study groups and go to at least one tech event. 

#### Remembering my goals.####
I kept getting caught up in how quickly I was progressing through the program (and comparing my progress to others’) that I lost track of my larger goal, to switch careers.

#### Setting small, attainable goals.####
To get back into coding, I set small daily goals to only do a certain number of lessons/labs or work for a set amount of time. Often, I find that by the time I have completed my goal for the day, I am in a coding groove and want to continue working. But if I don’t want to continue coding, I can stop guilt free because I accomplished my goal for the day. (Pro tip, this technique also works for doing chores you hate!)
Next time I feel stuck, I plan to go back and refactor earlier projects and implement all of the new things I learned since I made them, or write a blog post on a topic I didn’t quite get the first time around. 

#### Turning to a non-coding hobby to decompress.####
I took a day off and worked on a giant crocket wall hanging that I have been working on for at least 7 months. I’m still not done, but taking some time off to work on it again was really relaxing, and I plan to take more breaks to work on it in the future!

#### Remembering that it may be hard to regain my momentum.####
I’m a noob, I can’t go from zero to 60 that quickly. It may take me a day or two, or even a few weeks to really get back into it, and that’s ok! 

**Bottom line:** don't be so hard on yourself! Take time off and take care of yourself. If you are also experienceing burnout, I hope this can help you get your groove back.
